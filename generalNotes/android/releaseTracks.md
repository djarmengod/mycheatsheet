## Tracks

**Internal test:** Create an internal test release to quickly distribute your app for internal testing and quality assurance checks.

**Closed:** Create a closed release to test pre-release versions of your app with a larger set of testers. Once you've tested with a smaller group of employees or trusted users, you can expand your test to an open release. On your App releases page, an Alpha track will be available as your initial closed test. If needed, you can also create and name additional closed tracks.

**Open:** Create an open release after you've tested a closed release. Your open release can include a wider range of users for testing, before your app goes live in production.

**Production:** When you create a production release, this version of your app is available to all users in the countries you've targeted.
