## Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency
Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
   hostnames.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
   which may have different performance and connectivity
   characteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
   or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
   that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
   establishing a connection more quickly.  This document specifies
   requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
   provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy Eyeballs".u
