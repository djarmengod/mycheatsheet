## Overview
Google Play’s app serving model, called Dynamic Delivery, uses Android App Bundles to generate and serve optimized APKs for each user’s device configuration, so users download only the code and resources they need to run your app. You no longer have to build, sign, and manage multiple APKs to support different devices, and users get smaller, more optimized downloads.

## Benefits
A unique benefit of Dynamic Delivery is the ability to customize how and when different features of your app are downloaded onto devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher. For example, to reduce the initial download size of your app, you can configure certain features to be either downloaded as needed on demand or only by devices that support certain capabilities, such as the ability to take pictures or support augmented reality features.
