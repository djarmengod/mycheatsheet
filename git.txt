Branch Types:
1. Local branch tracking remote
2. Local branch not tracking any remote
3. Remote branch not in local

Create Local Branches tracking the Remotes.
for remote in `git branch -r`; do git branch --track ${remote#origin/} $remote; done

git fetch --all
* fetch updates local copies of remote branches so this is always safe for your local branches BUT:
* fetch will not update local branches (which track remote branches); if you want to update your local branches you still need to pull every branch.
* fetch will not create local branches (which track remote branches), you have to do this manually.

To update local branches which track remote branches:
git pull --all

$ git checkout -b release origin/release
Branch 'release' set up to track remote branch 'release' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'release'
